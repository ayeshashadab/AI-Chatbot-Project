In today's digital era, customers expect quick and reliable assistance while shopping online. "Quick Support" is an AI-powered chatbot tailored for a home decor and
furniture website. Built using PyTorch and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this chatbot automates customer support by addressing frequently asked questions,
such as product details, payment options availability, and order tracking. The chatbot is trained through NLP techniques and is built on the NLP pipeline along with 
concepts of Neural networks and aims to assist customers regarding their common questions and queries. This project was an inspiration and a clone of a general AI 
chatbot made by Patrick Loeber. â€¢
The chatbot aims for: -Enhance Customer Experience: Respond instantaneously, accurately, and contextually relevantly to customer inquiries, ensuring a seamless and satisfying shopping experience.
-Automate Customer Support: Reduce the dependency on human agents for handling repetitive and straightforward queries, allowing the support team to focus on more complex and value-driven tasks.

-Ensure 24/7 Availability: Offer uninterrupted assistance to customers, regardless of time zones or working
